```javascript
const rtcConfiguration = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' },
    // Add your TURN servers here
    {
      urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
      username: 'your-username',
      credential: 'your-password'
    }
  ],
};
```

### Room Types
- **Meeting**: Interactive mode where all participants can speak and share video
- **Webinar**: Host-controlled mode where attendees are muted by default

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - Ensure browser has permission to access camera/microphone
   - Check if other applications are using the camera
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Can't connect to other participants**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure WebRTC is supported in your browser
